Here I will try to keep track of various configurations and there throughputs. 

KernelConfig.cpp:
threadLoads = 1;
workgroupSize = 64;
workgroupTileSizes[dim] = tile_size * 16; // 16
threadCounts = {16, 4};


// gives items_per_second=1.87847k/s. For



threadLoads = 4;
workgroupSize = 64;
workgroupTileSizes[dim] = tile_size * 64;
threadCounts = {64, 1};

items_per_second=2.15452k/s -------------> That is 372 us, out goal (tile and fuse) is 250 us.
